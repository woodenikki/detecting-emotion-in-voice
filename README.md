# MoodWave: Voice-Driven Emotion Detection

## Requirements
Your dataset must be:

    Appropriate for classification. It should have a categorical outcome or the data needed to engineer one.

    Usable to solve a specific business problem. This solution must rely on your classification model.

    Somewhat complex. It should contain a minimum of 1000 rows and 10 features.

    Unfamiliar. It can't be one we've already worked with during the course or that is commonly used for demonstration purposes (e.g. Titanic).

    Manageable. Stick to datasets that you can model using the techniques introduced in Phase 3.

## Business Question
Can we develop a model that accurately detects the emotion in a personâ€™s voice? This could be useful for customer service applications to gauge caller satisfaction.

## Dataset

Datasets include audio recordings of speech with labeled emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry).

## Phase 3 Concepts used:

- Logistic Regression:

> Logistic regression is a fundamental classification algorithm that's well-suited for binary and multiclass classification tasks. It's a good choice if your dataset has clear decision boundaries.

- Decision Trees:

> Decision trees are versatile and interpretable models that can handle both categorical and continuous data. They are particularly useful when you want to understand the decision-making process of your model.

- Evaluation Metrics (Confusion Matrices, ROC Curves, AUC):

> These metrics are essential for assessing the performance of your classification model. They will help you understand how well your model distinguishes between different emotional states.

- Hyperparameter Tuning and Pruning:

> When using decision trees, tuning hyperparameters and pruning are important to avoid overfitting and to ensure your model generalizes well to new data.
